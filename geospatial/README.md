# `/geospatial`


## Capabilities we hope to develop

1. Visualization
2. Data loading (patches of labels and imagery to be used in a Random forest, PyTorch or TF model)
3. Data downloading (documentation walk-throughs mostly)
4. Interactive map for displaying and discussing input and model output
5. Interactive re-labeling tool (see the the landcover [repo](https://github.com/microsoft/landcover))
6. Bring your own data (BYOD)
7. "Default" models for segmentation and detection
8. Model evaluation metrics computataion over an area / split


## Content

- [geospatial_recipes.md](geospatial_recipes.md): a list of recipes for working with geospatial data using the GDAL command line tools


## TODO

-[ ] Add a meta class for segmentation and detection models
-[ ] Add a visualization class for viewing raster labels
